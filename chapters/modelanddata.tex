\section{Datasets and Models}
\label{sec:dataandmodel}
In this section we will discuss common datasets for FER. We will also present our steps to analyze which techniques we will need to use to increrase robustness of FER models against speech by analyzing the performance of human annotators against the RAVDESS dataset. We then go into details on the models we built and trained for our work.
